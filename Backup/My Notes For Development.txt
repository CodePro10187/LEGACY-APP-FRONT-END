Used the email service - https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin
Make a service , template before sending mails.

There is a Profile picture upload issue after adding email part so i decided to back up files and edit it later

The files will be at "Backup" folder
	UserRegister.jsx - with Email service(do not need confirmation page because it does both)
	ContactFormTesting - Testing Functioning page with out errors
